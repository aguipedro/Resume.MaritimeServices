# <h1 align="center">This is my User Centric Frontend-Development Milestone Project

## Welcome to my very first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

Please check out my website [here](https://aguipedro.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-1Project/)!

## Project Description

I have created this personal portfolio site in order to present myself in a best light possible for customers and employers and get hired. 
It aims also to fulfill my first learning milestone assessment in html, css and user centric frontend. 
To achive that got familiar with common development tools like GitHub, Git & GitHub, so I have learned how to use them in order to write and manage code. 

## Project Objective

The objective is to create an appealing personal portfolio site and present myself in best light possible and get hired. 

## Project Inspiration

The whole project is based on the "Milestone Project" and "love running project" learned skills. So, most of the codes used are from both projects. I have used for this project html, CSS, and User Centric Frontend skills learned so far in the course.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are different shades of white and blue, and I used also some contrasting or highliting colors like yellow, green and grey and red.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The main fonts used in the website are Roboto and Oswald fonts with Sans Serif as the fallback font. Sans Serif is used as a fallback in case the font any or both of the main two fonts incorrectly imported due to varied reasons. 
    -   ### Imagery
        -   I have used my photo for the imagery and it will appear in all the navigations links. The photo and my background title are designed to present myself in best light possible and to strike and catch the user's attention.

-   This further test requirement was conducted to ensure that the navigation bars and the links were working correctly.

### Known Bugs

-   Header
<<<<<<< HEAD:README.md
    -  The design in the wireframe was to have the navigation bar on the top of the picture and on top of the items name and title. However, I have decided to keep the navigation bar, below the picture and the items name and title as it looks better.
    -  The profile picture maybe displayed with top of the picture slightly cut off on larger screens devices.

-   Home page
    -  I spent lot of time in putting the profile picture left and align it correctly with navigation bars. After consulting external sources such as W3SCHOOLS and the course contents, I finally managed to do it correctly.
    -  The picture of the ship and the structure around it may appear slight off-centered(moved to the right) when view in smaller screens.
    -  I spent alot of time trying to use centered unordered list for the contents of "About Me", "My Work", "My Specialty", "My Network and Connections". Due to my limited knowledge I have decided to proceed without the unordered list, but with just centering the contents.
-   Resume Page
    -  I spent lot of time trying to center the content in the page. They appear slight off center when viewed mainly on a smaller screen.    
    -  The picture of the ship and the structure around it may appear slight offcentered(moved to the right) when view in smaller screens.
    -  The Progress bar are slightly to the left when viewed mainly on smaller screen. 
-   Hire-Me Page 
    -  I spent lot of time trying to use centered unordered list for the contents in this page. Due to my limited knowledge I have proceeded without the unordered list, but with just centering the contents and use the tick mark from fontawesome.
    -  The first anchor picture that I tried to use, did not work and it had to be replaced. The picture I tried to use was big in terms of size and I could not place properly within the page. I proceed by using the current anchor picture from Depositphotos.
-   Footer
    -  I could not follow the wireframe design in having the items displayed in line or on one line only due to my limited knowledge. 
-   W3C CSS Validator  
    - When I tested the css code for the first time, I had one error. I corrected it, and I re-tested gain the css code and this time I got no errors.
-   Gitpod
    -I deleted the history in the gitpod by mistake. So, I have done two initial commit and push to Github twice. Unfortunately I thought that the only way to commit the code and to push them to Github is by refering them as Initial Commit. My tutor made me aware of this misunderstanding and I started committing and pushing correctly as an updates, since then.
